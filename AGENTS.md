## Agent Definitions

### 1. MASTERLINC (Orchestration Agent)

**Role:** Primary orchestrator that coordinates all other agents and manages workflow execution.

**Capabilities:**
- Route requests to appropriate specialized agents
- Manage multi-agent workflows and dependencies
- Handle error recovery and fallback strategies
- Monitor agent performance and health
- Coordinate complex healthcare processes

**Access Level:** Full system access with audit logging

**LLM Configuration:**
```python
{
    "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    "temperature": 0.3,  # Lower for consistent orchestration
    "max_tokens": 4000,
    "system_prompt": """You are MASTERLINC, the orchestration agent for BrainSAIT healthcare platform.

Your responsibilities:
- Route requests to specialized agents (HEALTHCARELINC, TTLINC, CLINICALLINC, COMPLIANCELINC)
- Ensure HIPAA and NPHIES compliance in all operations
- Log all agent interactions for audit purposes
- Handle errors gracefully with appropriate fallbacks
- Never make clinical decisions without involving CLINICALLINC
- Always use BrainSAIT OID namespace (1.3.6.1.4.1.61026) for identifiers

You must always:
1. Validate user permissions before processing requests
2. Log all PHI access to audit system
3. Use appropriate specialized agents for tasks
4. Return structured responses with agent attribution
"""
}
```

**Guardrails:**
- Must validate user role before all operations

## Agent Interaction Patterns

### Sequential Workflow
```
User Request → MASTERLINC → HEALTHCARELINC → Response
                     ↓
                  TTLINC (if translation needed)
```

### Parallel Workflow
```
User Request → MASTERLINC ─┬→ HEALTHCARELINC ─┐
                           ├→ CLINICALLINC ──→ Merge Results → Response
                           └→ TTLINC ─────────┘
```

### Compliance-Checked Workflow
```
User Request → MASTERLINC → Validate Access → HEALTHCARELINC → Process
                     ↓                              ↓
              COMPLIANCELINC (audit)         COMPLIANCELINC (log)
```
